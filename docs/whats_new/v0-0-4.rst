v0.0.4 (October 14, 2020)
=========================

New features
------------

* We have validated the following components: compression heat pump, compression chiller, stratified thermal storage and concentrating solar power (CSP). The documentation of the CSP validation is postponed due to data licensing issues.
* An excess sink has been defined in the facades of the solar thermal and the concentrating solar power component to prevent energy systems from being unsolvable because of heat overproduction.

Documentation
-------------

* Improvements in the documentation of the stratified thermal storage have been made.
* We improved and extended the examples section in the documentation.

Bug fixes
---------

* A warning for missing required parameters has been implemented in the concentrating solar power component.

Other changes
-------------

* We have cleaned the examples of the stratified thermal storage component and made it more transparent.
