"""
Example on how to use the 'calc_cops' function to get the
COPs of a compression chiller using pd.Time-Series as input.

We use the ambient air as heat sink (high temperature reservoir). The input is
a list to show how the function can be applied on several time steps. The
output is a list as well and may serve as input (conversion_factor) for an
oemof.solph.Converter.
